This repository holds the code for my website: [www.christiansanchez.dev](https://www.christiansanchez.dev)

This is my first major coding project that I've undertaken.

I'm building this site as a platform to show off other projects I'm working on and a method for others to communicate with me. I started the process of building my website from scratch in the fall of 2021. I expect this to be a fluid and on-going project as other changes outside of the website will inevitably happen and will force updates or changes to the website.

More information and etails about this website can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/SquareHammer89/christiansanchez-dev/wiki) that I've built.
