***DISCLAIMER:*** I am not a financial advisor, this program is for educational purposes, and should not be taken as investment advice.

***NOTE:*** This README.md is split into two parts: The **Jupyter Notebook** version and the **Python Web App** version.

I'm currently working on a web app version of the program. This will be a full-feature website that will be worked on constantly.

This project is focused on providing financial information for companies listed on major U.S. stock markets.

I use Google Cloud Platform to host the web app and Flask as the framework.
View the **google-cloud-app** folder to view the files used to build the web app.
