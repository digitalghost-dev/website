***DISCLAIMER:*** I am not a financial advisor, any financial tools found on my website are for educational purposes **only**, and should not be taken as investment advice.

This repository holds the code for my website: [www.digitalghost.dev](https://www.digitalghost.dev)

This is my first major coding project that I've undertaken.

I'm building this site as a platform to show off other projects I'm working on and a method for others to communicate with me. I started the process of building my website from scratch in the fall of 2021. The changelog below will reflect new pages.

More information and etails about this website can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/SquareHammer89/christiansanchez-dev/wiki) that I've built.
