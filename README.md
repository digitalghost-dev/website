This repository holds the code for my website: [www.digitalghost.dev](https://www.digitalghost.dev)

This is my first major coding project that I've undertaken.

I'm building this site as a platform to show off other projects that are focused on data engineering *(I'm working on becoming a data engineer)*. I started the process of building my website from scratch in late summer of 2021.
